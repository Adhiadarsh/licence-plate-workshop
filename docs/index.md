## Welcome to the RHODS Workshop: Licence plate recognition!

In this workshop, you'll learn how to use RHODS to recognize licence plates in car pictures, and extract the number from this plate.

We'll start from this:

Then we'll automatically recognize and extract this:

From which we will recognize the plate number, **S7JDW** !

And all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to **RHODS**!
